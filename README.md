## Introduction

### Goal

My target was to implement a Rick and Morty themed Tic Tac Toe game in which Mortys' would be human players and Ricks' would be unbeatable computer/ai players further more I wish to add different personas of Morty and Rick as AI players i.e Evil Morty(unbeatable ai) and Doofus Rick(random computer) that would give edge to Morty(human player).

Further, I think game can be extended by adding different persons to human players such introducitng persons such as Jerry who would give lucky move to players by either auto marking best move or making Rick make a mistake(computer picking random move instead of best move). Beth would make Rick make two random moves.

I got lot of inspiration and code ðŸ˜… from [fly-app-tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/fly-apps/tictac). However it did substantial modification to the code to get it working with the updated Phoenix LiveView stack and fashioned it according to my concept of the game.
